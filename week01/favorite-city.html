    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite city is Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. It is known as the
        “City that Captured the Sun” because of its warm desert climate, with
        bright sunshine almost all year long. Mexicali is a border city next to
        Calexico, California,and is famous for its unique blend of Mexican and
        Chinese culture, especially its renowned Mexicali-style Chinese food. The
        city is also an important center for industry, agriculture, and education
        in northern Mexico, while still offering a relaxed, friendly atmosphere
        that makes it special to both locals and visitors.
