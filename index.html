        <p>Hello my name is Josue Ferla. I am originally from Southern California. I like the creative experiment of the
            human condition.Life is like trying out different ideas to see what works. Being human is about learning,
            making mistakes, and creating
            new things as we go. Writing music, painting, starting a family or businesses such experimentation with what
            it means to be human, shaping, forming, creating lives with different brushes. Such as times I feel
            philosophical and others I can't wait to sit at home and be done with the day.</p>
