      Hello my name is Josue Ferla. I am originally from Southern California. I like the creative experiment of the
      human condition.Life is like trying out different ideas to see what works. Being human is about learning,
      making mistakes, and creating
      new things as we go. Writing music, painting, starting a family or businesses such experimentation with what
      it means to be human, shaping, forming, creating lives with different brushes. Such as times I feel
      philosophical and others I can't wait to sit at home and be done with the day.

      Utah is a western state in the United States known for its drastically diverse landscapes. From towering red rock formations, fantastically fathomable canyons, and natural arches contrasting with snow-capped mountains and alpine forests. The Great Salt Lake, vast (high) deserts, and several, 5 in fact, national parks like Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef highlighting its natural beauty. This unique mix of desert, mountain, and lake terrain makes Utah a place of stunning variety and outdoor adventures to be had.
