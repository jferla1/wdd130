        Hello my name is Josue Ferla. I am originally from Southern California. I like the creative experiment of the
        human condition.Life is like trying out different ideas to see what works. Being human is about learning, making
        mistakes, and creating
        new things as we go. Writing music, painting, starting a family or businesses such experimentation with what it
        means to be human, shaping, forming, creating lives with different brushes. Such as times I feel philosophical
        and
        others I can't wait to sit at home and be done with the day. This has been a fun class to learn more about web
        design and development. I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS and look forward to learning more. I first
        remember getting familiar with HTML as a MySpace kid. The fun of customizing my page and learning how to do it.

      <p>
        Utah is a western state in the United States known for its drastically diverse landscapes. From towering red
        rock
        formations, fantastically fathomable canyons, and natural arches contrasting with snow-capped mountains and
        alpine
        forests. The Great Salt Lake, vast (high) deserts, and several, 5 in fact, national parks like Zion, Arches,
        Bryce
        Canyon, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef highlighting its natural beauty. This unique mix of desert, mountain, and
        lake terrain makes Utah a place of stunning variety and outdoor adventures to be had.
